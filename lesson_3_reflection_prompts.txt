When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When many online contributors need to access my project or to keep my
    project online so that I can access it anywhere without my laptop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    for flexibility I think


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks - cloning someone else repository on github itself
    clones - downloading repo from github or cloning in another location
    branches - different commits at different places

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    For fast forward merging

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    With both using Git and Github of course.
    Using these while collaboration will be a lot easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    To prevent any major bugs.
