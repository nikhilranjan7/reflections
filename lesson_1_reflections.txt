How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped in finding the errors in newer versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Firstly if changed certain features and removed others these version
    control will surely help.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    First of all, we have manual choice of when to commit so as discussed manual
    saving can be done at when done a major logical change to be noted down.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Well git is specific to programming where we need to look at various
    versions.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git diff is used to compare two versions of the same file while git log is
    used to view list of all changes done it that repository.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Now with version control I don't need resist in making any experimental
    changes as anytime made a mistake can always revert back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Will use it for software developments.
